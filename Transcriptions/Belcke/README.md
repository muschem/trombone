# Belcke

Friedrich August Belcke (1795-1874) was a renowned German trombonist and early advocate of the trombone as a virtuoso instrument. He performed with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra under Felix Mendelssohn and the Royal Court Orchestra of Berlin for 42 seasons, and his career as a soloist spanned over 30 years. As a composer, Belcke contributed several pieces to the corpus of trombone literature, including pedagogical works, duos and trios, as well as solo repertoire. 

# Op. 62 - 7 Etudes for Bass Trombone with Piano Accompaniment

The work is self-described as written for "bass" trombone. However, our modern concept of the large bore, multi-valved bass trombone had not yet emerged at the time the work was composed. In fact, the *quartventil* or "fourth valve", invented by Christian Friedrich Sattler, didn't come along until 1839. Some years earlier (circa 1821), the same Sattler combined the larger bore and mouthpieces common to the then valveless bass trombones in F with the typically much smaller bore tenor trombone in Bb, creating what was referred to as the *Tenorba√üposaune* or "tenor-bass trombone". It is likely that Belcke's work was intended for this tenor-bass instrument, or what we might think of today as simply a large bore symphonic tenor trombone. 

# Op. 43 - 12 Etudes for Bass Trombone

In similar fashion to Op. 62, these studies work well on a tenor-bass. Some of the studies may seem familiar - for example, study #1 in this work appears as study #2 in O. Blume's "36 Studies for Trombone".
