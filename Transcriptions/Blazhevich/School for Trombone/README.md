# Blazhevich - School for Trombone

These individual study transcriptions are based on the 1925 edition of Blazhevich's method, which is available in the Public Domain. While these transcriptions focus on the exercises themselves, the author's notes throughout the method are worth referencing along with the music.

## Section 1 - Studies in Positions

The method is generally divided into two main sections, the first of which includes fundamentals such as position charts, scales and arpeggios, and practice suggestions which are not included in this transcription set. The 34 etudes in the first section are described as "Studies in Positions". They begin with short exercises that can be played entirely in 1st position, and proceed to add positions until all 7 are covered. All exercises in this section have a key signature devoid of sharps and flats, and instead make extensive use of accidentals. Throughout both sections, Blazhevich makes use of various time signatures, both common and relatively esoteric. Tessitura ranges from below the bass clef staff to high Bb (third line, treble clef). The combination of uncommon time signatures, accidentals, and range make these exercises a challenging introduction to clefs. Modern methods, which remove much of the complexity present in these studies, and instead focus simply on learning to read clefs, may be more palatable for first introductions to the topic.

| 26-29 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6    |
| 30-34 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 |

## Section 2 - Exercises in All Seven Positions

In the second section, studies continue in all 7 positions, starting in the key of C maj/A min, and progressively adding flats and sharps. These etudes are generally longer than those from the first section, and they include more variation in tempos, articulations, dynamics and other musical shaping. Students who have prepared all-state audition etudes from Voxman's "Selected Studies for Trombone" may recognize several of the studies in this section (though these versions will have the added challenge of changing clefs).
