# Blazhevich

Vladislav Mikhailovitch Blazhevich (3 August 1881 â€“ 10 April 1942)

Blazhevich's music education began at the age of 12 in an army band in Smolensk, where he played euphonium and trombone. At 18, he moved to Moscow, where he continued to study music at the Moscow Conservatory. He later became Professor of Trombone at the same conservatory, and would go on to spend 22 years (1920 - 1942) in that position. 

His "School for Trombone" method is widely studied by trombonists, notable for its brief introduction to, and extensive use of tenor and alto clefs, in addition to the more familiar bass clef. To many it is known as the Blazhevich "Clef Studies". Blazhevich wrote his initial draft of this well known method in 1916, before his appointment to the Conservatory.
