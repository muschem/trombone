# Drei Equale f√ºr vier Posaunen

Three Equals for four trombones, [WoO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoO) 30:

1. Andante D minor
2. Poco adagio D major
3. Poco sostenuto Bb major

These three short equals (etymology: Latin, voces aequales - equal voices/parts; signifying in vocal or instrumental music two or more performers with an equally important part) were written by Ludwig van Beethoven. Aequales were traditionally used in Austria to commemorate the dead, as part of *Commemoratio Omnium Fidelium Defunctorum* (The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed - otherwise known as **All Souls' Day**), or in funeral services. These three equals were commissioned in 1812 for use as tower music on All Souls' Day, and they were first performed at the Old Cathedral, Linz that same year. Two of the equals (#1 and #3) were later performed at Beethoven's funeral in 1827, while the remaining equal (#2) was sung at the dedication of his gravestone on the first anniversary of his death in 1828.
