# Albert Robert Müller

Albert Robert Müller, more commonly known as Robert Müller, was a German trombonist born in 1849. He was a member of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra as well as a teacher at the Royal Conservatory of Music.

## Technical Studies

Among other works, Müller authored a series of studies for trombone in volumes of increasing difficulty. As technical studies, tempos are not specified. Instead, Müller directs: "The Tempo of these Studies is entirely at the discretion of the player." Similarly, dynamics are rarely marked. 

### Technical Studies, Book III

Whereas the first two technical studies books focus heavily on shorter, topical exercises in scales, arpeggios, intervals, and articulation patterns, similar in many respects to material found in the Arban method, Müller's third book combines these isolated exercises into longer studies, which are both more challenging and musically interesting. This book is comprised of 22 original studies from Müller, 30 studies in clefs from Belcke and Kopprasch, and Cornette's "Six Important Studies" (transcribed separately from the original source, and available [here](https://github.com/muschem/trombone/tree/main/Transcriptions/Cornette)). For transcriptions of the first 22 original studies, we reference the public domain source available from IMSLP here: [Technische Übungen III]("https://imslp.org/wiki/Technische_%C3%9Cbungen_(M%C3%BCller-Hartmann%2C_Robert)").
