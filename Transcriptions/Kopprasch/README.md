# Georg Kopprasch

Georg Kopprasch (1800-1850) was a German composer and horn player, and the son of composer Wilhem Kopprasch (1750-1832). He is best known for his sets of 60 etudes -  opus 5 for [high horn (cor alto)](https://imslp.org/wiki/60_Etudes_for_High-Horn%2C_Op.5_(Kopprasch%2C_Georg)), and opus 6 for [low horn (cor basse)](https://imslp.org/wiki/60_Etudes_for_Low-Horn%2C_Op.6_(Kopprasch%2C_Georg)). Some publications of these works incorrectly list "C" rather than "G" as a first name abbreviation, including the Carl Fischer (arr. Friedrich Gumbert) editions most familiar to trombonists.

## Opus 6

Of the two sets of 60 studies, opus 6 is by far the more well known and used. The studies are typically used by students at the advanced high school or collegiate levels. Transcriptions for trombone have included a number of modifications, from altered notes/lines to avoid the low trigger range, to removing entire measures. In these transcriptions, we endeavor to blend elements of the first edition with modifications present in the later Gumbert arrangements. "First edition" refers to the Breitkopf und HÃ¤rtel publication dating from 1833.

### Errata

* Study #10: (#9 in the horn editions): The Gumbert editions for both horn and trombone omit measure #28 from the first edition. 
* Study #11 (#13 in the horn editions): The Gumbert editions for both horn and trombone omit measures #35 and #36 from the 1st edition. In measure #34 of the Gumbert editions, the first two eighth notes were transcribed down a third vs. the same notes in the 1st edition - F and A in the Gumbert horn edition, compared to A and C# in the 1st edition. Here, we combine the editor's dynamic and articulation markings from the Gumbert editions with the missing measures and changed notes from the 1st edition. 
* Study #14 (#19 in the horn editions): In bar #21, the Gumbert editions add a second repeat terminating at the final bar, which does not exist in the first edition. Various dynamic and articulation markings differ between the Gumbert and first editions.
* Study #16 (#14 in the horn editions): Throughout the Gumbert arrangements, the tuplets with leading grace notes are marked with contrasting articulations of three staccato notes vs. the slur-two, staccato-one pattern for the non-ornamented tuplets. This differs from the first edition, where the ornamented tuplets retain articulation patterns consistent with the non-ornamented tuplets. In the trombone edition, the tuplet pickup to bar #17 omits a grace note, which is present in both the Gumbert horn and first editions. Measure #25 appears twice in the Gumbert editions, while only once in the 1st edition. 
* Study #19 (#22 in the horn editions): The trombone edition expands (explicitly writes out) the turns and omits the trills compared to the horn editions. Bar #12 in the trombone edition is missing a sharp for the first note of the measure.
* Study #20 (#17 in the horn editions): In bar #8, the Gumbert editions swap the 2nd and 3rd eighth notes in the first tuplet compared to the straight descending arpeggio in the first edition. 
* Study #22 (#27 in the horn editions): In bar #23 (third measure of the second section after the 1st/2nd endings), the 1st edition has articulation markings reversed as compared to the Gumbert editions - that is, in the first edition, the pattern is marked two staccato + two slur, vs. two slur + two staccato. At first glance, the 1st edition marking may seem less consistent without the context of the following measures, which also reverse an earlier articulation pattern (slur 3 + staccato 1 becomes staccato 1 + slur 3). 
* Study #23 (#31 in the horn editions): Measure #14 from the 1st edition is omitted in the Gumbert editions. The Gumbert editions also contain an extra 5 bars (measure #45 through #49), which do not exist in the original edition. The Gumbert editions change the original articulation in the next-to-last bar from groups of slur 2 + staccato 2 to slur 4. 
* Study #24 (#30 in the horn editions): Articulation patterns vary throughout both Gumbert editions as compared to the 1st edition. In bar #5, the last triplet is comprised of descending 3rds in the 1st edition, whereas the same figure in the Gumbert edition descends by steps. This difference repeats in bar #26. The last triplet in the bar #27 ascends step-wise in the 1st edition, compared to a descending figure in the Gumbert editions. 
* Study #25 (#23 in the horn editions): Both Gumbert editions omit measure #12 from the 1st edition, and begin the following measure a whole-step lower than the 1st edition. 
* Study #27 (#21 in the horn editions): In the 1st edition, both sections are repeated, while in the Gumbert editions, only the first section is marked with a repeat. 
* Study #29 (#32 in the horn editions): The Gumbert editions expand this study significantly to 62 measures, compared to the 1st edition, which has only 34 measures. 

### Notes

* In the trombone source edition, study #10 modifies the original horn study by replacing trills with turns. 

## Opus 5

While Op. 6 studies are more familiar, a great Brass Urtext edition of the opus 5 studies was produced by Benny Sluchin, and [described by Doug Yeo](https://yeodoug.com/kopprasch.html) with links to download the bass trombone adaptations:
