# Georg Kopprasch

Georg Kopprasch (1800-1850) was a German composer and horn player, and the son of composer Wilhem Kopprasch (1750-1832). He is best known for his sets of 60 etudes -  opus 5 for [high horn (cor alto)](https://imslp.org/wiki/60_Etudes_for_High-Horn%2C_Op.5_(Kopprasch%2C_Georg)), and opus 6 for [low horn (cor basse)](https://imslp.org/wiki/60_Etudes_for_Low-Horn%2C_Op.6_(Kopprasch%2C_Georg)). Some publications of these works incorrectly list "C" rather than "G" as a first name abbreviation, including the Carl Fischer (arr. Friedrich Gumbert) editions most familiar to trombonists.

## Opus 6

Of the two sets of 60 studies, opus 6 is by far the more well known and used. The studies are typically used by students at the advanced high school or collegiate levels. Transcriptions for trombone have included a number of modifications, from altered notes/lines to avoid the low trigger range, to removing entire measures. In these transcriptions, we endeavor to blend elements of the first edition with modifications present in the later Gumbert arrangements. "First edition" refers to the Breitkopf und HÃ¤rtel publication dating from 1833. 

### Errata

* Study #5, which is a preparatory study for trills, from the horn edition is skipped in the trombone edition. So, #5 in the trombone edition aligns with #6 from the first edition, and this off-by-one misalignment continues through #11, where other shifts are made.
* Study #9 in the Gumbert editions for both horn and trombone omit measure #28 from the first edition. Without a compelling reason to carry the omission forward, the measure has been included with this transcription.
* Study #11 (#13 in the horn editions) in the Gumbert editions for both horn and trombone omit measures 35 and 36 from the 1st edition. In measure 34 of the Gumbert editions, the first two eighth notes were transcribed down a third vs. the same notes in the 1st edition - F and A in the Gumbert horn edition, compared to A and C# in the 1st edition. Here, we combine the editor's dynamic and articulation markings from the Gumbert editions with the missing measures and changed notes from the 1st edition. 
* Study #13 in the Gumbert trombone edition is #16 in both the Gumbert horn edition and the first edition. 
* Study #14 in the Gumbert trombone edition is #19 in both the Gumbert horn edition and the first edition. In bar #21, the Gumbert editions add a second repeat terminating at the final bar, which does not exist in the first edition. Various dynamic and articulation markings differ between the Gumbert and first editions.
* Study #16 in the Gumbert trommbone edition is #14 in both the Gumbert horn edition and the first edition. Throughout the Gumbert arrangements, the tuplets with leading grace notes are marked with contrasting articulations of three staccato notes vs. the slur-two, staccato-one pattern for the non-ornamented tuplets. This differs from the first edition, where the ornamented tuplets retain articulation patterns consistent with the non-ornamented tuplets. In the trombone edition, the tuplet pickup to bar 17 omits a grace note, which is present in both the Gumbert horn and first editions. Measure 25 appears twice in the Gumbert editions, while only once in the 1st edition. 
* Study #17 in the Gumbert trombone edition is #24 in both the Gumbert horn edition and the first edition. 
* Study #19 in the Gumbert trombone edition is #22 in both the Gumbert horn edition and the first edition. The trombone edition expands (explicitly writes out) the turns and omits the trills compared to the horn editions. Bar 12 in the trombone edition is missing a sharp for the first note of the measure.
* Study #20 in the Gumbert trombone edition is #17 in both the Gumbert horn edition and the first edition. In bar 8, the Gumbert editions swap the 2nd and 3rd eighth notes in the first tuplet compared to the straight descending arpeggio in the first edition. 
* Study #21 in the Gumbert trombone edition is #20 in both the Gumbert horn edition and the first edition.
* Study #22 in the Gumbert trombone edition is #27 in both the Gumbert horn edition and the first edition. In bar 23 (third measure of the second section after the 1st/2nd endings), the 1st edition has articulation markings reversed as compared to the Gumbert editions - that is, in the first edition, the pattern is marked two staccato + two slur, vs. two slur + two staccato. At first glance, the 1st edition marking may seem less consistent without the context of the following measures, which also reverse an earlier articulation pattern (slur 3 + staccato 1 becomes staccato 1 + slur 3). 

### Notes

* In the trombone source edition, study #10 modifies the original horn study by replacing trills with turns. 

## Opus 5

While Op. 6 studies are more familiar, a great Brass Urtext edition of the opus 5 studies was produced by Benny Sluchin, and [described by Doug Yeo](https://yeodoug.com/kopprasch.html) with links to download the bass trombone adaptations:
