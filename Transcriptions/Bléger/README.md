# Michel Bléger

Michel Bléger was a prolific French composer, with a corpus of over 700 works for various instruments (https://data.bnf.fr/en/14829963/michel_bleger/). Among these works are studies designed for trombone. 

## 30 Brilliant Studies

Perhaps better known as "31 Studies" (the work was published as a group of 31 etudes, despite the title), after the edition published in 1962, edited by Allen Ostrander. Studies 21-29 contain very similar scale-based patterns repeated across 9 different keys. For transcriptions included here, we return to the 1883 Margueritat edition, available from the National Library of France. A scan of this edition is included for reference. Mr. Bléger was very sparing with dynamics in these etudes, and a comparison against later editions will provide guidance for shape of lines to make these studies sound less technical and more musical. 

### Notes

It was common practice in older French music publications for an accidental to apply across octaves within the same measure, unlike the modern convention of disambiguating the accidental with explicit marking in each octave. The former approach appears to have been in place for the source material in many places. We apply the modern convention to these transcriptions, not as a modification of the work, but to make clear the original intention to modern eyes.
